<!--<h3 class="pizzaz">&nbsp;</h3>-->
<p>Welcome to the Milan Rifle Club home page. The Milan Rifle Club was established as a private club in 1923 when Dr. WM. H. & Silence Otis donated the original 90 acres for use as a rifle range. The Range was founded on competition and friendship in a free society. <br /><br />
        Since the beginning, the club has been associated with the National Rifle Association with a goal of providing a safe facility for its members to compete in the various shooting sports. You must be a member of the NRA in order to be a member of the Milan Rifle Club. <br /><br />
        Membership in the Milan Rifle Club is not required to compete in formal competitions. All other use of the club facilities does require membership. You can find information about membership and an application to join the club <a href="membership.php">on the Membership page</a>. <br /><br />
        Membership includes individuals from both the Iowa and Illinois Quad-Cities and the surrounding areas(which includes the cities of Davenport, Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock Island, Moline, East Moline, Illinois.)<br />
        <br /><br />
        Additional information on the various disciplines/competitions can be found on their individual pages.      </p>
