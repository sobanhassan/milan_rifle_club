        <h1>Bullseye Pistol</h1>
        <p>Bullseye Pistol is fired on the Indoor ranges from a distance of either 50 feet up to a distance of 75 feet (25 yards). The indoor course   of fire is Slow Fire 10 shots in ten (10) minutes. 10 Shots (10) Timed Fire fired in two strings of 20 seconds each. The targets start from the edged position and will face for 20 seconds. Then Rapid Fire, we call this twice as much fun in half the time. Fire 2 strings of 5 shots each   in ten (10) seconds. Once again the targets will start in the edged   position and then face for 10 seconds. The Slow fire portion is fired on the B-2 Target and the timed &amp; rapid are both fired on the B-3   target.</p>
