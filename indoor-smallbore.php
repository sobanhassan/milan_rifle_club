        <h1>Indoor Smallbore</h1>
        <p>From  November through March each year the Milan Rifle Club fields a team shooting  Four Position Smallbore Rifle indoor in a local league. The team competes  against teams from the Davenport Shooting Association and the New Windsor  Rivoli Rifle and Pistol Club.</p>
        <p>Four Position Smallbore (.22 rimfire) involves a total of  40 shots for score, with 10 shots fired from the prone, sitting, kneeling, and  standing/offhand positions. Unlimited sighters are allowed. The target is the  NRA A-17 target, placed at 50 feet. While it seems a short distance, the  approximately 1/8&rdquo; diameter 10-ring can be challenging. Shooting jackets are  allowed, kneeling rolls are allowed for kneeling, and slings are allowed for  all positions except standing/offhand. Any optic is allowed, with most individuals  using scopes. If an individual is not comfortable or able to shoot a particular  position, they can substitute a less stable position.</p>
        <p>There are nine team matches through the winter, roughly  every other week, with practices held on the off-weeks. All matches and  practices are held Thursday afternoons on the Indoor 25 Yard range (mid-October  to the end of March). For matches, the team score consists of the top five team  member&rsquo;s scores. The league is handicapped so anyone having a good night  shooting, whether new to the game or          experienced, can help the team score. Individuals are classified based on their  personal scores throughout the season, and at the end of the season the top  scores for every shooting position, within each classification,&nbsp;receive awards.  Costs are a one-time $5 for the season for league cost, and $1 per match shot.</p>
        <p>The Four Position Smallbore Rifle league provides a nice  opportunity to get together and shoot rifles during the winter months. Many use  it to keep up their skills for various summer matches. The league is informal,  and not all members make every match or practice. Team members can arrive and  rotate through the different positions at different times, providing  flexibility. New shooters are welcome and encouraged! There is no limit to the  number of members on the team, and individuals can join at any point in the  season.</p>
        <p>If you are interested, contact the Indoor Smallbore  Discipline Chair or stop by the Indoor 25 Yard range on Thursday afternoon. To  get started, all you really need is a .22 rifle, some way to see your hits on  the target 50 feet away, eye and ear protection, and some ammunition. Something  to lie down on like a mat or piece of carpet will make prone shooting more  enjoyable. If you have a sling, shooting jacket, or kneeling roll, you can  bring them but they aren&rsquo;t needed to get started. Many on the team have shot  for        a while before buying some of the extra gear. Just join us and we will help you  figure it out.</p>
