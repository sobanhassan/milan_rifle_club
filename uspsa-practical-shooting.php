        <h1>USPSA / Practical Shooting</h1>
        <h1>(Milan Practical Shooters)</h1>
        <p>Practical shooting is a sport that uses multiple stationary targets, moving targets, reactive steel targets, obstacles, and movement to navigate a course of fire. There are multiple divisions for different types of pistols.</p>
        <p>You will need a gun belt, holster, and a way to carry extra ammo as some stages will require reloading and normally require 50 to 100 rounds to shoot the whole match.</p>
