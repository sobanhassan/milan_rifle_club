        <h1>Milan Rifle Club Youth Pistol Program</h1>
        <p>The Youth Pistol Program is  designed to introduce and promote amateur shooting sports to youth by educating  them in safety, sportsmanship, competition, and the ethical use of firearms.  This program is overseen by the Youth Shooting Sports Association (YSSA) which  provides the certified instructors, coaches, equipment and range safety  officers for the practices and events that are held at the Milan Rifle Club  (MRC).<br />
          <br />
          No experience or equipment is needed to get a youth started in the program and  we usually have ammunition available at prices below wholesale. The  &nbsp;competitive team is called the Steel Smashers and is open to any program  participant. The program is open to all youth ages 12 and up until they  graduate from college. There are participation fees in the local and national  governing bodies. The program&nbsp;runs from September 1st â€“ August 31st.  &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
        The Youth Pistol Program practices are held Tuesday nights at MRC starting  around 5 -6 PM and running until dark April through October. We move inside for  practice during the winter months.</p>
